# CMPG 323 Project 4 - 3374359

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing Robotic Process Automation (RPA) using UiPath Studio for user acceptance testing (UAT) of a web application. The aim is to automate the testing process to ensure that the web application functions as expected before deployment into production.

## Prerequisites
Before executing this project, ensure the following:
- You have created a UiPath Automation Cloud account.
- UiPath Studio Community Edition is downloaded on your computer.
- You can access the web application designated for UI automation testing.
- You have retrieved the Excel file containing the test data.

## Implementation Options
For this project, the provided web application [web application URL] will be used. The focus is on adapting the UiPath solution for RPA implementation of testing.
